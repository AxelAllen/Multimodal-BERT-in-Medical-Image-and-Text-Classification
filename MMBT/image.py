This code is adapted from the image.py by Kiela et al. (2020) in https://github.com/facebookresearch/mmbt/blob/master/mmbt/models/image.py
and the equivalent Huggingface implementation: utils_mmimdb.py, which can be
found here: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/8ea412a86faa8e9edeeb6b5c46b08def06aa03ea/examples/research_projects/mm-imdb/utils_mmimdb.py

The ImageEncoderDenseNet class is modified from the original ImageEncoder class to be based on pre-trained DenseNet
instead of ResNet and to be able to load saved pre-trained weights.

This class makes up the image submodule of the MMBT model.

The forward function is also modified according to the forward function of the DenseNet model listed here:

Original forward function of DenseNet

    features = self.features(x)
    out = F.relu(features, inplace=True)
    out = F.adaptive_avg_pool2d(out, (1, 1))
    out = torch.flatten(out, 1)
    out = self.classifier(out)
