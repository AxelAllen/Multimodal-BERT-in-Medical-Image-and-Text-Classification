5232,CXR983_IM-2471-1001.png,1," Normal heart size and mediastinal contours. There are reticular opacities in the medial right middle lobe with tubular airway ectasia which obscures the right heart XXXX. This was present previously and is most compatible with bronchiectasis. There is no XXXX focal airspace disease. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Unremarkable XXXX. 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process. 2. Stable right middle lobe bronchiectasis, XXXX postinfectious/postinflammatory. ."
5970,CXR1991_IM-0648-2001.png,1," The heart is normal in size. The mediastinum is stable. The lungs are hypoinflated. There are XXXX streaky opacities predominantly in the left lung base possibly related to scarring and atelectasis. XXXX B-lines are also noted. Definite infiltrate is not excluded. There is no large effusion. 1. Low lung volumes with streaky left basilar opacity, XXXX subsegmental atelectasis and scarring. Infiltrate is XXXX less XXXX but not entirely excluded. 2. Mild central vascular congestion and bronchovascular crowding."
4648,CXR112_IM-0080-1002.png,1, Previous lower spine cervical fusion. Lungs are overall hyperexpanded with flattening of the diaphragms consistent with obstructive lung disease. Lungs are clear without focal consolidation. No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces. Heart and mediastinum of normal size and contour. Degenerative changes in the spine. Hyperexpanded but clear lungs.

Heart size and mediastinal contour are within normal limits. There are diffuse degenerative changes of the spine. 1. No focal airspace consolidation. 2. Mildly hyperexpanded lungs, suggestive of obstructive lung disease."

Negative for pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Limited evaluation reveals the XXXX XXXX to be grossly intact. 1. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
