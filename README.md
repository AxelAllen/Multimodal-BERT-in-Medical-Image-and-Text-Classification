# Pre-Trained Multi-Modal Text and Image Classification in Sparse Medical Data Application


## Dataset

For more information regarding the dataset utilized in the project and the
preparation steps, please consult the information in the **data** directory.  

Before proceeding to train and test the model, the frontal X-ray image files used in the 
experiments can be obtained via the link to this [Shared Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VmpB1kNLESDMGL5eoglMtlsgj32zkR9P?usp=sharing).

For access to all X-ray images, include non-frontal images, please refer to
this [Other Shared Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OP6aPLMF4ib2kTCTp9YeG0b6zVVorfKW?usp=sharing).


The frontal images should be saved to the **data/NLMCXR_png_frontal** subdirectory inside
the **./data/** directory.  

The X-ray images from the other shared Google Drive should be saved to the **data/NLMCXR_png** subdirectory inside
the **./data/** directory.  

Please note that these 2 subdirectories are **NOT** included in this repo and will need
to be created as part of the preparation steps to reproduce the experiments.
